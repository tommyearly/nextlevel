# Google Ads — Recommended Negative Keywords (Next Level Web)

Copy each section into a **Negative keyword list** in Google Ads (Tools & settings → Shared library → Negative keyword lists). Add at campaign or account level.

**Match types:** Use **phrase** or **broad** as noted. Broad = any word order; phrase = that phrase must appear.

## Usage

1. **Tools & settings** → **Shared library** → **Negative keyword lists**
2. Create list (e.g. "Next Level Web – Exclusions")
3. Add keywords above (one per line)
4. Attach list to your campaign(s)

Add more from the **Search terms** report once the campaign runs — block anything that doesn’t convert.
